Economic growth and technology are inseparable. Current economic conditions are promoting investment in technology, as emerging markets have increased the demand for technology to drive growth, while developed markets are seeking new ways to reduce costs and promote innovation. As digital technology promotes consumer income and demand, education and training, and the effective use of capital and resources, this will become a virtuous circle that will promote economic growth, especially in emerging markets.


Digital technologies are becoming faster, more powerful, and cheaper, and are merging with each other in more innovative ways to expand their potential. In the past of years, the virtuous circle of technological breakthroughs has become the core driving force of global economic growth, and its importance has increased day by day. It has changed the way we work, play, communicate and think.


In the course of the past 60 years, information and communication technology (ICT) has evolved from a highly specialized and limited role in processing information to a universal tool that can be applied to almost any activity. The emergence of the Internet in the 1990s promoted the production and sharing of data and changed the potential of ICT.


ICT infrastructure is a necessary prerequisite to benefit from ICT. Therefore, the statistical indicators showing the infrastructure and the scope of access are the obvious starting point for the core list. The main players in society are people, companies, and governments, so ideally, the core list should include indicators on the access and use of ICT by these players. Therefore, collecting data for these indicators requires additional efforts by a large number of countries.


The suggestions about the core indicators on use of ICT by businesses are mainly based on development work undertaken by the OECD’s Working Partyon Indicators for the Information Society (WPIIS), work being done by Eurostat and individual OECD member countries on this topic, and feedback received on an earlier paper on this topic. Some indicators are: a) Proportion of business using computers, b)Proportion of employees using computers, c) Proportion of businesses using the internet, d) Proportion of employees using internet, etc. 


For the collection of business ICT use indicators, in most countries, established procedures for conducting business surveys will be developed, and these procedures are also applicable to the collection of ICT use data. Most of the indicators generated by the ICT use survey are presented in the form of proportional data. They include: Proportion of the company's total population or subgroups, such as specific industries or size categories. In addition, countries may show the data as the proportion of companies which use the Internet or own a website, etc. Both the OECD and Eurostat designate "enterprise" as the statistical unit, which is the unit used in most OECD countries. The choice of unit is important because it affects the results obtained. Since the output of the ICT use survey is mainly proportional data, if the selected units are the same, it is more likely to achieve comparability between countries.




The impact of digital technology can be felt in all aspects of the economy. Once upon a time, the growth of an economy's technological manufacturing industry was a suitable barometer of the health of the digital economy. In the new era of technological progress, it can no longer be defined by such a narrow lens. The impact of digital technology now spans industrial structures and national boundaries to improve the performance of an increasingly diverse global network of interconnected enterprises.
ICT companies often face complex issues related to corporate law and intellectual property (IPR), especially ICT patents. Since ICT patents are bound to play a vital role in shaping the digital future of the world, the patent expertise required to solve ICT patent problems includes a thorough understanding of communication technologies, hardware devices, and components.


Information and communication technologies are increasing among different communities to obtain information about related problems, problems and their solutions. In the context of agricultural development, information and communication technologies have played an important role in developing countries. For example, mobile phones have narrowed the gap between farmers and purchasers. Now farmers communicate directly with customers to obtain product prices from the market. Mobile phones also provide farmers with a new way to get the latest weather information from the meteorological department before applying pesticides on the farm. ICT used by the health sector has well-known advantages. They can promote patient-centered healthcare, improve the quality of care, and educate health professionals and patients. However, the implementation of ICT is still difficult, involving changes at different levels: patients, healthcare providers, and healthcare organizations.

Questions


1.Why ICTs can play a considerable role in simplifying interactions with public authorities?
This is due thanks to the digitization and automation of many processes.

2.What is proportion of households with a ratio?
This indicator refers to radio access by in scope households. The equipment should be in working order to expected to be returned to working order season.

3.What is ICT?
Is the combination and integration of computer work stations, telecommunications, electronics, networks and information media that affect individuals, firm and economy as a whole.

4.Why ICT are important?
The larger utilization of ICT has reduced the communication costs which ultimately facilitated the flow of knowledge and information. 

5.What is Mobile broadband penetration? 
Is defined as the number of active mobile broadband services subscriptions, divided by the number of residents in each country

6.What could be a challenge for improvement in digital economy?
One of the challenges associated to measuring digital economy is to develop new and more flexible approaches to meet the specific priorities and resources of G20 countries. 

7. What is a crucial action in digital economy?
Enable the collaboration between the public and private sector to plan and implement business surveys about innovation and the uptake of new digital technologies.

8.How ICT helps in healthcare area?
ICT helps the management to improve the patient safety and satisfaction, get updated to the latest technology, have a knowledge on population health and statistics and keep a note on the government mandates on track.

9.What is a current problem of ICT in healthcare area?
A current problem is about data privacy that affects millions of patients due that there is no respect by this law, so this data is given to insurance companies that use that for sales and having more clients.

There are two types which are Traditional and Modern. Traditional ICT tools such as Radio, News Paper, Books, Pamphlets,printed materials of any and the other is Modern ICT tools such as Computer,Tab,Mac, Digital gadgets are highly supporting during the pandemic period.

11.  What could be an appropriate definition of Information Technology?
Information Technology refers to the use of hardware and software for storage, retrieval, processing and distributing information of many kinds.

12.What are the problems of information communication technology?
•	Cost and Duplication.
•	A decline in Social Activities.
